# ◼️ Binary Systems

Exploring procedural generation through a binary lens. Studies on chaos, continuity, and organic binary systems.

> Fueled by [p5-svelte](https://p5-svelte.netlify.app/) and late night creative brain funk.

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `pnpm i`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.
